# Smaller and faster than ms.
What more do you need to know?

## Features

- Tiny. The entire library is ~390 bytes, and fully tree-shakeable.
- Convert string durations to ms/seconds.
- Convert ms to human-readable string durations.
- Add durations to dates.

## Comparison to other top-rated libraries

## Performance

The only function most folks care about in terms of raw performance is string to ms conversion.  In this, itty stacks up pretty well, being significantly faster than [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms), but falling to the insanely-optimized [@lukeed/ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lukeed/ms).

Moral of the story, probably don't use [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms).

Use Luke's if you want the absolute fastest parsing, or itty if you want some of the other functions as well.  If you're byte-counting, itty wins again, but if you're byte-counting that hard, you're probably better off with raw ms math if you can stomach it.

## seconds/ms
<h4>
  <code>seconds(duration: TimeString | number) => number</code><br />
  <code>ms(duration: TimeString | number) => number</code><br />
</h4>

TTL math is a maintenance nightmare. It's a pain to write, a pain to read, and when you update the math later, you'll probably forget to update the comment, causing all sorts of mayhem.

```ts
const TTL = 2 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 2 weeks, right?
```

Here's a better way.

```ts
import { ms, seconds } from 'itty-time'

// to seconds
seconds('2 weeks') // 1209600

// to milliseconds
ms('2 weeks') // 1209600000
```

Duration strings are typed as `TimeString`, so typos like `ms('2 weekz')` fail at compile time rather than silently misbehaving.  If you're parsing arbitrary user input (that you've validated yourself), cast it:

```ts
import { ms, type TimeString } from 'itty-time'

ms(userInput as TimeString)
```

## duration
<h4>
  <code>duration(ms: number) => string</code>
</h4>

Of course, we sometimes need to go the other direction.  Want to tell a user how long ago something happened?  How much time they have left?

You could build it yourself, or import the fantastic [humanize-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration) library that inspired this, but at 6.3kB<sup>1</sup>, it's over 20x the size of this 280 byte function.

<sup>1: of course [humanize-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration) can also do much, much more.</sup>

```ts
import { duration } from 'itty-time'

duration(3750000)
// "1 hour, 2 minutes, 30 seconds"

// limit number of segments returned
duration(3750000, { parts: 2 })
// "1 hour, 2.5 minutes"

// change the delimiter
duration(3750000, { join: ' --> ' })
// "1 hour --> 2 minutes --> 30 seconds"

// or get the raw components
duration(3750000, { join: false })
/*
  [
    ['hour', 1],
    ['minutes', 2],
    ['seconds', 30]
  ]
/*
```

## datePlus
<h4>
  <code>datePlus(duration: TimeString | number, from = new Date) => Date</code>
</h4>

Sometimes you need a TTL for some point in the future, but sometimes you need the actual date.  You could convert it all yourself... or use this.

```js
import { datePlus } from 'itty-time'

// from right now
datePlus('2 months')

// or from a different date
datePlus('2 months', datePlus('1 week'))
```
